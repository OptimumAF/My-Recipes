Category: Breakfast  
Cooking Time: 35 minutes (15 minutes prep, 20 minutes baking)  
Feeds: Makes 12 muffins  
Bake Temperature: 350°F  

## Ingredients:
### Muffins:
- 3 bananas  
- 1 cup sugar  
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, room temperature  
- 2 eggs  
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
- 1 1/2 cups White Kamut flour  
- 1 teaspoon baking powder  
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda  
- 1/2 teaspoon French gray coarse salt  
- 3/4–1 cup blueberries  
- 1 tablespoon White Kamut flour  

### Streusel:
- 1/4 cup butter, softened  
- 1/4 cup sugar  
- 1/4 cup brown sugar  
- 1/4 cup White Kamut flour  
- 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon  

## Instructions:
1. **Prepare the oven and muffin tin**:  
   - Preheat the oven to 350°F. Generously coat a muffin tin with cooking spray.  

2. **Make the muffin batter**:  
   - In a large bowl, mash the bananas. Add sugar and butter, and mix using a dough hook or electric mixer until smooth.  
   - Add the eggs and vanilla extract and mix until combined.  

3. **Combine dry ingredients**:  
   - In a separate bowl, mix the Kamut flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the dry mixture to the banana mixture all at once and stir until combined.  

4. **Prepare the blueberries**:  
   - Place the blueberries in a small bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon of flour. This helps prevent the berries from sinking.  
   - Gently fold the floured blueberries into the batter.  

5. **Fill the muffin tin**:  
   - Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin tin cups.  

6. **Make the streusel topping**:  
   - In another bowl, mix the softened butter, sugar, brown sugar, Kamut flour, and cinnamon until crumbly.  
   - Sprinkle the streusel evenly over the top of each muffin.  

7. **Bake the muffins**:  
   - Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.  

8. **Cool and serve**:  
   - Let the muffins cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.  

## Note:
These muffins freeze well and make a convenient breakfast or snack.
