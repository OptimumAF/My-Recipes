Category: Main Course  
Cooking Time: 30 minutes  
Feeds: 4-6 servings  

## Ingredients:
- **Main**:  
  - Small uncooked tortillas  
  - Ground beef  
  - Garlic salt  
  - Canola oil  

- **Add-Ons**:  
  - Lettuce (shredded)  
  - Salsa  
  - Cheese (shredded)  
  - Sour cream  

- **Sides**:  
  - Rice  
  - Beans  

## Instructions:
1. **Prepare the tacos**:  
   - Take a tortilla and place ground beef on less than half of the tortilla in a half-circle shape, leaving space towards the center so it can be folded.  
   - Sprinkle the meat with garlic salt on the exposed side.  
   - Set the prepared tortillas aside on a tray or plate.  

2. **Cook the tortillas**:  
   - Heat about 1/2 inch of canola oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Test if the oil is ready by inserting a wooden spoon; it should lightly bubble.  
   - Place the prepared tortillas in the skillet one at a time. Cook them flat in the oil for about 1–2 minutes, or until the meat starts to color.  
   - Fold the tortilla into a taco shape and continue cooking until the tortilla browns and the meat is fully cooked, about 2–3 minutes.  
   - Remove the taco from the skillet, allowing excess oil to drip off, and place it in a container lined with paper towels.  

3. **Assemble the tacos**:  
   - Add your desired toppings such as lettuce, salsa, cheese, and sour cream.  

4. **Serve**:  
   - Pair the tacos with sides of rice and beans for a complete meal.
