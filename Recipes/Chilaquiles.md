## Ingredients:
- Tortilla chips (thick, sturdy chips recommended)

### Optional Toppings:

## Instructions:

1. **Warm the Salsa**:

   - Gently stir to coat evenly. Allow chips to soften slightly, cooking for about **2–3 minutes**.

3. **Cook the Eggs**:  
   - In a separate skillet, cook eggs to your preference (fried, scrambled, or poached).

4. **Assemble and Serve**:  
   - Divide the salsa-coated tortilla chips among serving plates.  
   - Top each serving with cooked eggs.

5. **Add Toppings**:  
   - Finish by adding toppings of choice, such as cheese, avocado, cilantro, radishes, and crema or sour cream.
