# Herbed Biscuits

Category: Side Dish  
Cooking Time: 35 minutes (20 minutes prep, 15 minutes baking)  
Feeds: 16 biscuits  

## Ingredients:
- 4 cups flour  
- 2 tablespoons baking powder  
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt  
- 8 tablespoons (1 stick) cold butter, cut into pieces  
- 1/2 cup snipped fresh chives, thyme, or sage  
- 2 cups milk  

## Instructions:
1. **Prepare the dough**:  
   - Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and butter in a bowl. Use a food processor or pastry cutter to pulse or mix the mixture until it resembles pea-sized crumbs.  

2. **Incorporate the herbs and milk**:  
   - Add the snipped herbs (chives, thyme, or sage) and milk to the mixture. Mix or pulse until just combined, being careful not to overwork the dough.  

3. **Shape the biscuits**:  
   - Transfer the dough to a floured surface. With floured hands, gently pat it to a 3/4-inch thickness.  
   - Use a biscuit cutter or the rim of a glass to cut the dough into 16 rounds.  

4. **Prepare for baking**:  
   - Lightly sprinkle the tops of the biscuits with flour. Place them on a baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch of space between each biscuit.  

5. **Bake the biscuits**:  
   - Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Bake the biscuits for about 15 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top.  

6. **Serve**:  
   - Let the biscuits cool slightly before serving. Enjoy them warm with butter or your favorite spread.
