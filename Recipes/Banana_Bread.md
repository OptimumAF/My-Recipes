# Banana Bread

Category: Baking
Cooking Time: 1 hour 10 minutes
Feeds: 8-10 slices

## Ingredients:
- 2 to 3 medium bananas, ripe (about 1 to 1 1/4 cups mashed)  
- 1/3 cup melted butter, unsalted or salted  
- 1 teaspoon baking soda  
- Pinch of salt  
- 3/4 cup sugar (adjust to taste, can reduce to 1/2 cup)  
- 1 large egg, beaten  
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour  

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and butter a 4x8-inch loaf pan.  

2. In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until smooth. Stir in the melted butter.  

3. Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Add the flour and stir until just incorporated.  

4. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake for 50–60 minutes at 350°F, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. If the top of the bread browns too quickly, tent it with foil in the last 10 minutes of baking.  

5. Remove the loaf from the oven and let cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Transfer the loaf to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.
