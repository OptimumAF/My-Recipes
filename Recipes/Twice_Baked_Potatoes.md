Category: Side Dish  
Cooking Time: 1 hour 20 minutes (1 hour initial bake + 15–20 minutes second bake)  
Feeds: 8 servings  
Bake Temperature: 400°F (initial), then 350°F  

## Ingredients:
- 8 baking potatoes, washed  
- 3 tablespoons canola oil  
- 2 sticks salted butter, sliced into pats  
- 1 cup bacon bits (fry your own for best flavor)  
- 1 cup sour cream  
- 1 cup Cheddar or Jack cheese (or a mix), plus more for topping  
- 1 cup whole milk  
- 2 teaspoons seasoned salt  
- 3 green onions, sliced (optional if freezing)  
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste  

## Instructions:
1. **Bake the Potatoes**:  
   - Preheat the oven to 400°F.  
   - Place the potatoes on a baking sheet, rub them with canola oil, and bake for 1 hour, or until thoroughly cooked.  

2. **Prepare the Filling**:  
   - In a large mixing bowl, add the butter, bacon bits, and sour cream.  

3. **Hollow the Potatoes**:  
   - Remove the potatoes from the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 350°F.  
   - Slice each potato in half lengthwise and carefully scrape out the insides into the mixing bowl, leaving a small rim of potato inside the shells to support them.  
   - Lay the hollowed-out potato shells on the baking sheet.  

4. **Mix the Filling**:  
   - Smash the potato insides into the butter, bacon, and sour cream until smooth.  
   - Add the cheese, milk, seasoned salt, green onions (if not freezing), and black pepper to taste. Mix thoroughly.  

5. **Fill the Shells**:  
   - Spoon the mixture back into the potato shells, making sure to heap the filling generously.  
   - Top each potato with additional grated cheese.  

6. **Bake Again**:  
   - Bake the filled potatoes at 350°F for 15–20 minutes, or until warmed through and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
