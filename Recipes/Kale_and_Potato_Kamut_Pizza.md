Category: Main Course  
Cooking Time: 2.5 hours (including dough prep)  
Feeds: Makes 3 (8–10-inch crusts) or 6 individual pizzas  
Bake Temperature: 500°F  

## Ingredients:
### Pizza Dough:
- 1/2 cup warm milk  
- 1/2 cup warm water  
- 2 teaspoons sugar  
- 2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast  
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil  
- 1 3/4 cups White Kamut flour  
- 2 teaspoons French gray coarse salt  

### Toppings:
- 2–3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  
- 1 medium russet or Yukon Gold potato, thinly sliced (skin on)  
- 1/4–1/2 cup kale, chopped  
- Fleur de Sel salt  
- 1/2 cup Buffalo or fresh mozzarella cheese, diced  

## Instructions:
1. **Prepare the Dough**:  
   - Warm the milk to lukewarm. In a large bowl, combine lukewarm milk, lukewarm water, and sugar. Sprinkle yeast on top, gently stir, and cover. Let sit for 5 minutes until foamy.  
   - Stir in the olive oil, flour, and salt. Mix with a wooden spoon or dough hook, then knead the dough until smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes). Use a timer to alternate between kneading and resting.  
   - Coat the mixing bowl with 1/4 teaspoon of olive oil. Place the dough back in the bowl, cover with a lightweight dish towel, and leave in a warm, draft-free place for 2 hours.  
   - Punch down the dough and divide into 3 balls. Let rest for 15 minutes. (Refrigerate for up to 24 hours or freeze for up to 3 months in separate portions. Let dough come to room temperature before use.)  

2. **Prepare the Pizza Base**:  
   - Roll out each dough ball to your desired thickness and shape on a lightly oiled surface. If using a pizza stone, preheat the stone in the oven for 1 hour before baking.  

3. **Add Toppings**:  
   - Drizzle a small amount of olive oil over the rolled-out pizza dough and spread it evenly with your fingers.  
   - Arrange thin potato slices in a single layer over the olive oil. Top with chopped kale, sprinkle with Fleur de Sel, and add diced mozzarella cheese.  

4. **Bake the Pizza**:  
   - Preheat the oven to 500°F. Place the pizzas directly on a preheated stone or baking sheet. Bake for 6–7 minutes or until the crust is crispy on the bottom and the cheese is melted.  
   - For traditional pizza with cheese, sprinkle the cheese 3 minutes before the pizza is done and finish baking.  

5. **Serve**:  
   - Remove from the oven and let the pizzas cool slightly before slicing. Serve warm.
