Category: Side Dish  
Cooking Time: 45-60 minutes  
Feeds: 2-4 servings  
Bake Temperature: 425°F  

## Ingredients:
- 4 large Russet potatoes  
- Olive oil  
- 1 tsp salt  
- 1/2 tsp black pepper  
- 1/2 tsp paprika  
- 1/2 tsp onion powder  
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder  
- 1/2 tsp Cajun seasoning  

## Instructions:
1. **Preheat the Oven**:  
   - Preheat your oven to 425°F.  

2. **Prepare the Potatoes**:  
   - Wash and scrub the potatoes thoroughly.  
   - Pat them dry with a paper towel.  
   - Using a fork, stab each potato every half inch around the entire surface. This helps steam escape and prevents bursting, also allowing the potato to cook all the way through.  

3. **Season the Potatoes**:  
   - Rub each potato with olive oil to coat the skin, be generous with the coating.
   - In a small bowl, mix the salt, black pepper, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and Cajun seasoning.  
   - Sprinkle the seasoning mixture evenly over the potatoes, rubbing it in for full coverage.  

4. **Bake the Potatoes**:  
   - Place the potatoes directly on the oven rack or on a baking sheet.  
   - Bake for **45-60 minutes**, or until the skin is crispy and a fork easily pierces the flesh. 60 minutes for a nice crispy exterior.  

5. **Serve**:  
   - Let the potatoes cool for a few minutes before cutting them open.  
   - Serve with butter, sour cream, and your **[Quick Garlic Butter Milk Sauce](Garlic_Butter_Milk_Sauce.md)** for extra flavor!
