# Crème Brûlée

Category: Dessert  
Cooking Time: 35–40 minutes (+ chilling time)  
Feeds: 6 servings  

## Ingredients:
- 3 cups heavy cream  
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar  
- 2 whole eggs  
- 4 egg yolks  
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract  
- 2 ounces Bailey's Irish Cream  
- 3/4 cup light brown sugar  

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 325°F.  

2. In a heavy saucepan, heat the heavy cream over medium heat until almost boiling, then remove from heat.  

3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, granulated sugar, vanilla extract, and Bailey's Irish Cream until smooth.  

4. Gradually whisk the heated cream into the egg mixture, mixing thoroughly to temper the eggs without curdling.  

5. Divide the custard evenly among 6 individual custard dishes. Place the dishes in a large baking pan.  

6. Fill the outer pan with hot water, ensuring the water reaches the level of the custard in the dishes. Carefully transfer the pan to the preheated oven and bake for 35–40 minutes, or until the custard centers are set but still slightly jiggly.  

7. Remove the custard cups from the water bath and let them cool. Cover and chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve.  

8. Before serving, sift the brown sugar evenly over the top of each custard, ensuring it covers the entire surface.  

9. Using a propane torch, carefully caramelize the sugar by moving the flame evenly across the surface until it melts and forms a golden-brown crust.  

10. Let the custard set for a few minutes to cool slightly, then serve immediately.
