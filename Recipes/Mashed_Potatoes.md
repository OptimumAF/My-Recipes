Category: Side Dish  
Cooking Time: 30 minutes  
Feeds: 4-6 servings  

## Ingredients:
- 1.5 lbs potatoes (about 5â€“6 medium, Russet or Yukon Gold)  
- 2 tablespoons clarified butter or ghee  
- 1/4 cup milk of choice (e.g., cashew milk)  
- 1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt (or sour cream as an alternative)  
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste  

## Instructions:
1. Peel the potatoes and rinse them thoroughly.  

2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully add the potatoes to the boiling water and cook until they break apart easily when pierced with a fork, about 20 minutes.  

3. Drain the potatoes thoroughly and mash them with a potato masher until the desired consistency is achieved.  

4. In a small saucepan, bring the milk and butter to a low simmer, whisking to combine.  

5. Add the Greek yogurt or sour cream to the mashed potatoes and stir well. Gradually pour in the warm butter-milk mixture while mashing to achieve smoothness.  

6. Season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste before serving.
