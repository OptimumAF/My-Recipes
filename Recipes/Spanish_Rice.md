Category: Side Dish  
Cooking Time: 30-40 minutes  
Feeds: 4-6 servings  

## Ingredients:
- 2 cups rice  
- 1 small onion, chopped  
- 4 cups warm water  
- Salt, to taste  
- 12 oz chicken broth  
- 1 small can tomato sauce  

## Instructions:
1. **Toast the Rice**:  
   - In a large skillet or pan, fry the rice over medium heat until golden and lightly toasted.  

2. **Add the Onion**:  
   - Stir the chopped onion into the rice. Stir only twice to prevent breaking the rice grains.  

3. **Add Liquids**:  
   - Once the rice is toasted, pour in the warm water, salt, and chicken broth. Stir to combine.  

4. **Incorporate Tomato Sauce**:  
   - Add the tomato sauce to the skillet and mix well to distribute evenly.  

5. **Simmer and Cook**:  
   - Cover the skillet with a lid and reduce the heat to low. Let the rice simmer until fully cooked and all the liquid is absorbed, about 20-25 minutes.  

6. **Fluff and Serve**:  
   - Remove from heat and fluff the rice with a fork before serving. Serve warm as a side dish for your favorite Mexican-inspired meals.
