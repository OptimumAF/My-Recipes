**Category**: Appetizer/Main Course  
**Cooking Time**: 45 minutes  
**Feeds**: 25-30 servings  

## Ingredients:
- 1 lb ground beef  
- 32 oz mixed vegetables  
- 1 onion, finely chopped  
- ¼ bulb of garlic, minced (about 4–5 cloves)  
- 1 cup soy sauce  
- 1 cup oyster sauce  
- 3 tablespoons vinegar  
- 1 tablespoon black pepper  
- 2 packs Menlo lumpia wrappers (25-30 wrappers per pack)  
- Cooking oil (for frying)

## Instructions:
1. **Prepare the Filling**:  
   - In a large skillet, combine ground beef, onion, garlic, soy sauce, oyster sauce, vinegar, and pepper.
   - Cook over medium-high heat until the meat is fully cooked through, stirring occasionally.

2. **Add Vegetables**:  
   - Once the beef mixture is cooked, add mixed vegetables and continue cooking for about 3–5 minutes, until vegetables are heated through but still crisp.

3. **Drain and Cool**:  
   - Remove from heat and thoroughly drain excess liquid from the filling.
   - Allow the filling to cool completely.

4. **Roll the Lumpia**:  
   - Place about 1–2 tablespoons of filling onto each lumpia wrapper.
   - Roll tightly, folding in the sides, and seal edges with a bit of water to hold the lumpia together.

5. **Cook Lumpia**:  
   - Heat cooking oil in a skillet or deep fryer over medium heat.
   - Fry lumpia in batches until golden brown, about 3–5 minutes per batch.
   - Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.

## Notes (Optional):
- Serve lumpia hot with sweet chili sauce, vinegar dipping sauce, or your preferred dipping sauces.
- Lumpia can be frozen uncooked and fried straight from frozen when needed.
